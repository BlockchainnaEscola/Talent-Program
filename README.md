# Talent Program

**Tracking Web3 talent from Brazilian public schools**

## What is this?

Students from public schools in Brazil rarely access blockchain education or Web3 career opportunities. This program changes that by identifying promising talent early and providing verifiable proof of their skills.

## How it works

We run intensive blockchain bootcamps at public schools. Students learn by doing - creating wallets, minting NFTs, deploying tokens, and interacting with smart contracts. Everything is recorded on-chain.

After each bootcamp, we document:
- Student wallet addresses
- On-chain activity (transactions, deployments, badges earned)
- Skills demonstrated
- Projects built

This creates a public registry of verified Web3 talent that would otherwise remain invisible to the ecosystem.

## Why this matters

**For students:** Verifiable credentials that don't depend on expensive degrees or privileged networks.

**For Web3 companies:** Access to motivated talent from underrepresented communities with proven on-chain experience.

**For the ecosystem:** A replicable model to expand Web3 access beyond traditional tech hubs.
