# Talent Program

**Tracking Web3 talent from Brazilian public schools**

Students from public schools in Brazil rarely access blockchain education or Web3 career opportunities. This program changes that by identifying promising talent early and providing verifiable proof of their skills.

We run intensive blockchain bootcamps at public schools. Students learn by doing - creating wallets, minting NFTs, deploying tokens, and interacting with smart contracts. Everything is recorded on-chain.

After each bootcamp, we document student wallet addresses, on-chain activity (transactions, deployments, badges earned), skills demonstrated, and projects built. This creates a public registry of verified Web3 talent that would otherwise remain invisible to the ecosystem.

- **For students:** Verifiable credentials that don't depend on expensive degrees or privileged networks.

- **For Web3 companies:** Access to motivated talent from underrepresented communities with proven on-chain experience.

- **For the ecosystem:** A replicable model to expand Web3 access beyond traditional tech hubs.

One bootcamp completed in Belo Horizonte (October 2025). 28 students with on-chain credentials. More programs planned for 2026.
